# ASCIITOS 🦟

![Current Build](https://github.com/DeWa/asciitos/actions/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml/badge.svg)

## Welcome to one of the best Command-line application design tool there is (if there even is others)  🚀

Ever wanted to create world-class command-line application but you were like "Oh maan... how do I design these views before I write the code?" Well, think no more! **ASCIITOS** is here to turn your keyboard into a digital paintbrush and your imagination into pixel-perfect design masterpieces.

### What even is this? 🤔

ASCIITOS is a web-based CLI design tool that lets you create stunning CLI UI designs fast and easily.

### Features That'll Make You Go "Wow!" ✨

🎨 **Multiple Drawing Tools**: Brushes, lines, circles, rectangles - we've got all the shapes your heart desires (except the heart shape) \
🎯 **Colorful Creations**: Not just black and white! You can choose foreground AND background color for every column. Something that one of those *main stream* ASCII editors didn't allow \
📄 **Multi-Page Magic**: Create all your applications views in one project \
💾 **Save & Share**: Export your masterpieces as JSON files and share them with the world \
🔄 **Undo/Redo**: Made a mistake? No worries, we've got your back \
**AND MANY MORE!** (okay... not so many more)

### Upcoming features 🤠

- More fonts (more than the one now :D)
- Image to ASCII (is this even possible? Let's see)
- Ability to create design for other resolutions than 80x25

### Built With Sweat, Tears and Love ❤️

This project is built with modern web technologies, but you don't need to know any of that to use it. Just open the app and start creating!
